This directory contains the fonts used by paperback for generating its PDFs
(due to the nature of PDFs, the fonts are embedded in every PDF document
created by paperback). All of the fonts used are freely licensed.

B612 is used for all of the data sections of paperback documents (to ensure
they remain highly readable in all context), and Roboto Slab is used for all
informational sections of paperback document (to remain somewhat consistent
with the usage of B612 while still distinguishing the data and informational
sections of the document).
